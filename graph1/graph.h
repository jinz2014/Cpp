    Interface file for _directed_ graphs.
    
    This is a very functional graph class, although it doesn't have every bell and whistle
    one might hope for.  One interesting design question is whether Has_cycle(void) should
    in fact be a member function of this class, or whether we should have some separate
    Graph_utility class (or even Has_cycle class) where we put such definitions.  You
    might keep this question in mind as we read Lakos and see if you can figure out what
    he would recommend in this case.
    
    This requires that the template type Vertex be totally ordered (i.e., < needs to be
    defined for objects of type Vertex).

/*
    We'll templatize Graph on two types.  One will be the type we'll use to
    represent a Vertex, and one will the type of the values that we associate
    with every edge.  Note that we don't always need values associated with edges
    (not all graphs are weighted).  This suggests that this interface has too much
    functionality for certain uses.  Given this, how might we change the design?
