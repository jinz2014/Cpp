  has_cycle.cpp

  Implementation of the member function Has_cycle in the graph class.
  This function determines whether there is a cycle in a directed graph.

  The basic algorithm is to start at each node, and move forward along
  every path from that node (using depth first search).  I mark every
  vertex as _visited_ as we pass through it, and mark every vertex as 
  _processed_ once we have gone down every path from that vertex.  As an
  efficiency trick, we can stop the depth first search whenever we encounter
  a _processed_ vertex.  If we ever re-encounter a _visited_ vertex during
  a depth first search, we've found a cycle and can terminate the process.

  This is in _no way_ optimal.  There are a number of choices that could
  have been made differently, and which would have led to significant
  differences in the resulting implementation.  As one example, I chose
  to make Has_cycle a member function of the graph class, when it could
  well have been made a free function that takes a graph and returns a
  bool, or a member of some graph utility class.  
  
  I've also chosen to not "pollute" the graph class with member
  variables (like the processed and visited sets) and typedefs (such as
  set< Vertex, less<Vertex> >) that are only used for this function.  This
  keeps the definition of the Graph class cleaner, but makes these functions
  messier, so there's obviously a trade-off.

  As you work through the Lakos text, you may want to occassionally return
  to this code and apply his ideas and measures to see how well this code 
  measures up, and in what ways his ideas might be used to modify this code.
